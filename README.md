# heroBot

heroBot is an automation framework for the Technical Support Teams. It aims to automate the troubleshooting process in the browser.

It uses browser automation technologies and love to fulfill its destiny.

## Rationale

In Support, there are many common cases that arise daily in user reports. Eventually, patterns emerge which the agent can use to identify known issues. Many of these patterns are repeatable, and hence create rote tasks that agents have to carry out. If we can abstract these patterns into data structures that define a process, we can automate testing for them using simple algorithms and browser testing technology.

## Benefits of Automation

- Removes guesswork and human error from troubleshooting

- Frees up time so that humans can work on the really meaningful projects that require a deeper level of expertise and human interaction. It empowers us to find better problems to solve rather than beating the same buttons for the same results every day

- Defining troubleshooting patterns in a standardized structure is also a way of documenting them, which in turn documents the product/system for which these patterns are built

- Having a standardized sturcture allows anyone to contribute new patterns regardless of their expertise with the product/system

- Being able to execute patterns many times enables capturing data automatically to inform further product developments and for the improvement of the automation system itself

- Automating troubleshooting is also good for the business as it optimizes the return on investment it gets from contributors

- Automating troubleshooting opens up the possibility of offering troubleshooting tools to users so they can use them in their restricted/staging environments, and for interaction deflection as we can surface issues to users before they have to reach out for Support
