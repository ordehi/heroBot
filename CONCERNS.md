# Concerns with Automation

### Some people fear they'll lose their jobs due to automation

First of all, fighting against automation is postponing the inevitable, so expecting to keep your job to do something that a simple algorithm can do is a recipe for failure that goes beyond your workplace.

Businesses have always been and will likely keep being about profits for the foreseeable future. As technology evolves and more people have access to more sophisticated systems that are increasingly easier to use, businesses will look to optimize their profits by reducing expenses and focusing on the truly important aspects of their product/service. Automation is already one of these optimizations being implement by more companies by the day.

As workers across the globe push for shorter work weeks and better work-life balance, a logical measure to ensure that productivity stays at an expected level and/or improves is to reduce the amount of light, busy, meaningless work, and maximize the work that only they can do in their area of expertise. This increases the appeal of automation, as the so-called light work--things such as checking emails, filling out forms, carrying out repetitive processes that follow a similar path across iterations--is one of the easiest to automate both because it doesn't present a difficult challenge and because it is the worst for productivity.

### The elevator operator

Do you remember elevator operators? If you do, either you're old, or watch a lot of movies/TV, or maybe you live in an area where this is still a vanity luxury.

An elevator operator sat, or stood, all day in an elevator and operated the elevator to go to the floors requested by the users (tenants, guests, customers, etc). This was at a time when elevators were complicated enough that the common folk either didn't know how to operate it, or allowing them to do so would be such a liability that it was worth paying a specialized employee instead.

As technology advanced and elevators became more sophisticated and easier to operate, it became harder to justify paying an employee to push buttons all day. The buttons are so clear as to what they do, that it now made sense to allow users to operate elevators themselves, and so gone were the days of elevator operators (at least in the sensible world).

A parallel story was taking place, as elevators advanced so were advancing telecommunication technologies. There used to be what were simply called "operators", you would pickup the phone and instead of dialing to your friend, an operator would pick up and ask who you wanted to be patched through to, you told them the name and some other information and once they found the person, they literally patched a cable that goes from your phone line to that of the person you wanted to reach.

Again, as technology advanced, it became unneccesary to have an employee do this, as we started being able to have phones patch themselves into the lines we intended to reach by using phone numbers. Eventually telecommunications became so advanced and easy to use for the user that there are rarely any operators or phone books to be found these days.

### The exodus

You can imagine that millions had to be laid off from their elevator operator, phone operator, and many other roles that were no longer relevant in the face of new technologies that simplified the processes they were specialized in to the point were the user was now the operator.

However, not everyone reacted equally, or was laid off. There were two main reactions to this exodus:

1. My life sucks, I'm going to lose my job and I don't know what to do. Maybe I can get my union to strike against this debacle. Users don't know the first thing about elevators, they'll probably fall to their deaths, they still need me. It will be a long time before just anyone can make an elevator go to their floor. Not every company has the resources to buy one of these expensive, user-operated elevators, I'll be fine.

2. Wow, it sucks that I won't be able to keep working in this that I'm so comfortable doing. What should I do? If elevators are going to be operated by users, it means they have to be in top shape to keep operating as expected. This means someone has to be employed to take care that the elevator is working properly, someone to carry out maintenance tasks, maybe even discover flaws in the elevator or suggest improvements.

Needless to day, the first group of people were likely laid off, and went on to either live a life of regret, or to hop different jobs and companies as the automation chased them away.

The second group of people, however, likely kept their jobs or educated themselves enough so that they could take advantage of the new system. If they worked for so long at something, they had a lot of insight and knowledge about that and they could bring it into whatever chapter came next for that thing.

### It's your choice

To this day, there are still elevator maintenance employees, and there will likely be such types of employees forever in one way or another.

There are also still to this day people that oppose progress in some way, whether it be by lamenting their position, by mocking the new ways as unfit, not ready, too expensive, too far off, or by actively fighting against those that implement them.

To this second group of people, there are two main options:

1. Keep being like this, and when the time comes where your position can no longer be justified, hop the world for whatever you can find

2. Pull yourself together and understand that as an individual you can't fight human progress and technology, but you also have the power to rise above the situation and educate yourself to do anything, whether it relates to the thing that's replacing you, or to something else entirely different. Getting a grip on yourself and growing is not that hard, but you need to be consistent in the face of a world built to distract and pull down on you.

### A world of possibility

There is so much that you can do to ensure you'll have a livelihood if your job were to be automated. You could learn about how this automation is built and become a maintainer, or creator. You could do something else entirely that fulfills you more than doing things which can be automated. You can invest so that you don't rely only on your day job.

We could speak all day about all the things you could do, but one thing you can obviously do is just sit and wait, and expect things to keep going the way they are, and for you to always have a place in the world that is the same place you are in now.

It's really on you to take action, or not. And then whatever happens, please look inwardly before you thank or blame the world.
